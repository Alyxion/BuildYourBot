# ðŸ¤– BuildYourBot ðŸ¤–

This repository contains several very basic examples about how to build a basic chatbot 
using the OpenAI API which tracks your chat history, summarizes it if needed, restores 
the history, and then continues the conversation, tracks the costs and token usage etc.

In addition it provides a very basic console app which can be used to test the API and
behaves like a math teacher. Feel free to write your own prompts and experiment with
it.
